# MySafeSpace
A few lists dedicated to social media word lists to block certain content from appearing. The name is ironic.

#

This repo contains keyword lists to block content from certain communities on social media. I made this to protect my mental health from troublesome content. These lists aren't against any communities; they're meant to help avoid political discourse by allowing people to block content they don't want to see.
