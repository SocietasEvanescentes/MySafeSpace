A few lists dedicated to social media word lists to block certain content from appearing. The name is ironic.

This repo contains keyword lists to block content from certain communities on social media. I made this to protect my mental health from troublesome content. These lists aren't against any communities; they're meant to help avoid political discourse by allowing people to block content they don't want to see.
